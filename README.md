# Google Cloud Functions - Offer Assignment Reference sample

The functions here will allow you to simulate a cash register system to synchronize personal coupon codes with the ACTITO offer module.

This package contains two functions:

1. First function: readFile

   This function reads files from a text file uploaded to google storage and adds the corresponding information in the google firestore database.

   Note that :

   - file must be a csv with one column named assignmentReference
   - fileName must be an offerReference in offerCatalog table

2. Second function: enrichAssignment

   This function triggers the enrichment of the assignment record with a personalized coupon code from the firestore database.

   Note that :

   - It will be called from the actito webhook when a new offer assignment is created.
   - It requires actito web service credentials to be stored in `functions/credentials/actito-credentials.json`.

## Insert your ACTITO credentials

save your actito informations to `.actito-credentials.json`
format should be:

```json
{
    "credentials": {
      "user": "licenceName/login",
      "password": "password"
    },
    "entity": "entityName",
    "env": "test" or "prod"
};
```
